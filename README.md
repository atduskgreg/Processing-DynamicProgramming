## Processing-DynamicProgramming

This is a Processing library that implements the Dynamic Programming optimized search technique along with a few of its fun applications.

It mainly based on [this tutorial by Paul Reiners](http://www.ibm.com/developerworks/java/library/j-seqalign/index.html) and the accompanying code (with some modifications).

So far, the coolest application (partially) implemented is Seam Carving, which is a technique for resizing images by removing their least interesting pixels. This isn't quite working yet but you can see the SeamCarvingExample for how it will work when it's done.
